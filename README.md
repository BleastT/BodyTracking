# BodyTracking
 Track your body and use your hands to control the volume level.
 
 To use it simply run the main.py script. This python program uses metapipe to track the body and the hands.
 It also uses the length between the index and the thumb to adjust the volume and to confirm your volume selection simply
 lower your pinky finger.
